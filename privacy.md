<h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

The following policy outlines how BUILDMETRIC
INC. (the “Company”) will collect, use, protect and disclose personal
information. Please note that this policy also applies to Internet and e-mail
use by the Company’s employees, contractors, clients, customers and suppliers.

<h2>What is Personal Information?</h2>

Personal information is any information which can identify an individual or through
which an individual’s identity can be deduced, and which is disclosed to us or which
we create within the context of our relationship with the individual. Please
note that Personal information does not include information  which does not
relate to an identified individual nor does it include an individual’s name,
title, business address or business telephone number (i.e. “business card
information”).

The Company’s privacy policy is based on the
Canadian Standards Association’s Model Code for the Protection of Personal
Information.

<h2>Why Does the Company Collect Personal information?</h2>

In serving the needs of the Company and its employees, contractors and customers, it is
important that the Company have accurate information. The Company may collect
personal information in order to:

* establish your identity
* understand your needs for, and determine your suitability for, products and services
* provide services to you and process payments for your account
* inform you of new products and services
* establish and maintain an employment or contractor relationship
* adhere to legal requirements

<h2>How Will Personal Information Be Used?</h2>

The Company may use personal information in order to:

* administer and maintain the employment relationship
* administer and maintain benefits
* comply with legal, regulatory and other obligations
* carry out our business operations

<h2>When Might Personal Information Be Disclosed?</h2>

The Company may disclose personal information in order to:

* administer and maintain the employment/contractor relationship
* administer and maintain benefits and payroll
* make hiring decisions
* submit quotes or proposals to prospective customers or clients
* enable employees/contractors to access client/customer facilities or that of the Company (ie. security clearances)
* explore and/or undertake corporate opportunities, including a merger, acquisition,
amalgamation, IPO, reorganization or sale of the Company, including the due
diligence process and the transfer of information through to closing of any
such transaction

<h2>How Does the Company Collect Your Personal Information?</h2>

We collect your personal information at the time you become a new customer, client, supplier,
employee or contractor of the Company and thereafter when we communicate with
you. For example, we collect your personal information through:

* our sales and supply agreements with you
* your discussions with our employees and contractors
* your visits to our website and/or intranet

Employees/contractors are responsible for
ensuring that changes to their personal information (i.e. address, telephone
number, social insurance number, banking information for the purpose of direct
deposit, etc.) are communicated to us.

<h2>How Does the Company Protect Personal Information?</h2>

Safeguards, security systems and processes are in place to protect your information against
unauthorized access, disclosure, use, or modification, whether on-site or
off-site.

Human resource files as well as information regarding payroll and benefits coverage
is accessible to those Company individuals who have been designated with such
authority and only to the extent necessary to accomplish the objectives we’ve
described above, or to the Company’s relevant benefits and/or payroll providers. 
All personal employee/contractor information maintained within the Company is
centrally located and is maintained secure and confidential.  All personal
information provided to the Company’s benefits and/or payroll providers is
disclosed only upon assurances that those providers maintain similar standards
of personal information protection.

<h2>How Long Will the Company Retain Your Information?</h2>

We retain your information for only so long as is necessary for the purposes for
which it has been collected.  Your personal information will be destroyed once
it is no longer needed by us and once all requirements at law have been met.

<h2>Have You Consented?</h2>

There are some instances where we may need to disclose personal information to a
third party service provider.  Whenever we engage a third party service
provider, we confirm that its privacy and security standards meet our
requirements.  In the event that a third party service provider is located
outside of Canada, the government, courts or law enforcement or regulatory
agencies of that jurisdiction may be able to obtain disclosure of your personal
information through the laws of that jurisdiction.

By submitting your personal information to us, you have consented to our use and
disclosure of the personal information for the purposes as outlined in this
policy.  If we wish to use or disclose your personal information other than as
described in this policy, we will obtain your express consent before doing so.

If you prefer that we not use or disclose your personal information for any of
these purposes, you may notify us in writing at any time.  If you do not notify
us, we will consider you to have consented to our continued use and disclosure
of your personal information.  A notification that we not use or disclose your
personal information for certain purposes may affect our ability to provide you
with products and/or services.

Please note that from time to time, we may be compelled to release personal information
as required or permitted by law.

<h2>How Can You Access Your Personal Information?</h2>

Your personal information, hard copy or
electronic, is accessible to you.  However please note that if your information
is combined with information of others (such as payroll spreadsheets), you will
not be granted access to such information unless we are able to segment your personal
information.  If your request for personal information entails a significant
cost due to time, resources or copying, there may be a charge.

<h2>Our Website</h2>

Each time you visit our website, we gather the
